# Description

This weather app was inspired by Dad who is a meteorologist.  The app is supposed to retrieve the user's location and show the current temperature.  Depending on the weather, the apps background image will change accordingly.

# What I learned

After learning location permissions from my GPSApp, it was not difficult for me to retrieve their location.  What I am curently stuck on, is figuring out how to use an API to retrieve data based on given conditions.  I found a tutorial showing the process for a similar API which I am planning to watch this weekend.
