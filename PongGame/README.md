# Description 

Similar to ping pong and tennis, Pong is a game where the main objective is to hit a ball at your opponent with the goal of making them miss.  When comlete, pong will be able to be played at various difficulties along with having a working scoreboard and tournament bracket.

# What I am learning

Currently, I am in the early stages of building the game (just finished the UI and physics) but I have already learned a lot.  I figured out how to have a ball move around without gravity or friction.  I also managed to create a paddle that moves where ever your finger is pressed and can deflect the ball back towards the opponent.  I have yet to create a scoring systme or an effective enemy AI.
