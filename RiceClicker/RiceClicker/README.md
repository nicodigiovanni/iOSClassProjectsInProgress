# Description

Similar to cookie clicker, Rice Cliker is a game which the main objective is to get the most grains of rice by tapping the image and purchasing upgrades.  What is unique about the app, is that I am utilizing a data base to keep track of the toal grains of rice earned buy all players.  After a few months following the release, I will donate the amount of rice earned from users to a charity.

# What I learned

I learne how to pull data from and setup a sql database. The reason I did not complete the app yet, is becasue I am in the process of trying to manipulate and push data back to the database.
